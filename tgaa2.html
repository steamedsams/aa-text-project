        <p>大逆転裁判２ -成歩堂龍ノ介の覺悟- (Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Kakugo) was first released in Japan on
            August 3, 2017 for the Nintendo 3DS. It was localized into English and released worldwide as "The Great Ace
            Attorney 2: Resolve," along with its predecessor, as part of "The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles" on July 27,
            2021 on PC and various consoles.</p>
        <p>A continuation of "<a href="tgaa1.html">The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures</a>," it follows Phoenix Wright
            ancestor and Japanese defence attorney Ryunosuke Naruhodo at the turn of the 20th century. Now with a few
            cases under his belt, Ryunosuke continues to solve crimes across Victorian-era London with his trusted
            judicial assistant, Susato Mikotoba. When an all-too familiar face unexpectedly turns up, and investigation
            into a murder case starts to blend the past and the present, it's up to Ryunosuke to steel his resolve and
            uncover the truth before it's buried for good.</p>
        <p>Before "The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles" was released, a YouTube channel known as "Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2"
            released a walkthrough of the game in Japanese with English subtitles. Their playlist can be found <a
