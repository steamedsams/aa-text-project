        <p>Why did I make this site? I wanted to study the original Japanese scripts of the Ace Attorney games, but I
            had trouble finding good Japanese transcripts online, so I decided to go through the games and make them
            myself!</p>
        <p>The truth is, I originally just wanted to make this a spreadsheet (I love spreadsheets), but I quickly found
            out that
            HTML was the only tool at my disposal that had <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana">furigana</a>
            support. I have experience in web development from my college days, so I brushed up on my skills and got to
            work!</p>
        <p>I tried to model this site after the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Transcripts">Ace Attorney Fandom wiki
                transcripts</a>. I created the Japanese transcripts
            from scratch, and used the wiki to match the Japanese and English text up with each other. This ended up
            leading to me catching small mistakes and typos in the wiki transcripts, which I was able to fix. So even if
            nobody ends up using this site, at least some good came out of my hard work!</p>
        <p>A Discord
            conversation with some of the first people I shared this project with gave me the idea to include a
            "Searchable Mode," which automatically expands all collapsible
            text for those searching through the script for a specific line. Trying to figure out what case a quote is
            from? This feature is for you! :)</p>

                            <p class="description">I first got into Ace Attorney in 2020, when I saw that one of my
                                favorite
                                YouTubers at
                                the time played through the first game. I've since played every game in the series
                                that's
                                been released
                                on
                                PC.</p>
                            <p class="description">I first took interest in the Japanese language after reading "Legends
                                of
                                Localization
                                Book 3: UNDERTALE", which documents the process of translating "Undertale", originally
                                an
                                English-language
                                game, into Japanese. It was really interesting to read about how text differed in
                                between
                                the two
                                languages,
                                and it made me want to study the original Japanese versions of games I've played in
                                English
                                to see how
                                <i>those</i> scripts differed too!
                            </p>
                            <p class="description">My first experience with studying the Japanese script of a video game
                                was
                                with "The Great Ace
                                Attorney 2:
                                Resolve," armed with only YouTube walkthroughs, my iPhone's "find text in images"
                                function,
                                and Google
                                Translate. If you have minimal knowledge of Japanese like I do, I hope this site makes
                                it
                                easier to comb through the Japanese text for you than it was for me
                                when I
                                started out.</p>
